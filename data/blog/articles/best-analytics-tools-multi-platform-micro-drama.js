        "Running a micro-drama studio in 2026 means distributing across multiple platforms simultaneously. A single series might premiere free episodes on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, gate later episodes behind a paywall on TikTok Series, and offer the full season on ReelShort or DramaBox. Each platform has its own analytics dashboard, its own metric definitions, and its own blind spots.",
        "The challenge is not a lack of data. It is the opposite: too much fragmented data with no unified view. Studios need an analytics stack that normalizes performance across platforms, tracks series-level metrics that no single platform provides, and delivers the financial intelligence needed to make production and distribution decisions. This guide covers the best tools for the job and how to combine them effectively.",
