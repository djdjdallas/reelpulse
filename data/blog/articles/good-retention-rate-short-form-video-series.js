        "If you create short-form video series, retention rate is the single most important metric you can track. Views tell you how many people found your content. Retention tells you how many stayed. For series specifically, retention has two dimensions: how long viewers watch each individual episode (in-video retention) and whether they come back for the next episode (episode-to-episode retention). Both matter, but episode-to-episode retention is what separates a hit series from a collection of standalone videos.",
        "The first question every creator asks is: what is a good retention rate? The answer depends on your platform, genre, series length, and audience. This guide provides the benchmarks you need for 2026, along with the context to interpret them and the strategies to improve them.",

      content:
        "Before looking at benchmarks, it is critical to distinguish between the two types of retention that matter for series creators. In-video retention measures how much of a single episode viewers watch. If your 60-second episode has an average watch time of 45 seconds, your in-video retention is 75%. This metric reflects the quality and pacing of individual episodes. Episode-to-episode retention measures what percentage of viewers who watched one episode went on to watch the next. If 100,000 people watched Episode 3 and 65,000 watched Episode 4, your Episode 3-to-4 retention is 65%. This metric reflects the strength of your narrative hooks, cliffhangers, and overall series appeal.",
    },
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      content:
        "Both types of retention interact. Poor in-video retention on Episode 3 (viewers swiping away before the end) usually leads to poor episode-to-episode retention from Episode 3 to Episode 4. Viewers who do not finish an episode are unlikely to seek out the next one. However, the reverse is not always true. You can have high in-video retention (viewers watch each episode fully) but low episode-to-episode retention if your cliffhangers are weak or your series does not create enough narrative urgency to bring viewers back.",

When comparing retention across series of different lengths, look at the retention curve's shape rather than the endpoint. A series that retains 60% through Episode 20 before dropping to 30% by Episode 50 has a different problem (late-series fatigue) than one that drops to 30% by Episode 5 and holds steady (weak early episodes, loyal core audience).",
