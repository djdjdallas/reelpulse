        "Every vertical drama creator faces the same high-stakes question: which episode should sit behind the paywall? Place it too early and you lose viewers who never got hooked. Place it too late and you give away too much value for free, leaving money on the table. The difference between a well-placed paywall and a poorly-placed one can mean a 3-5x swing in revenue per series.",
        "The good news is that finding the perfect paywall episode is not guesswork. With the right data and a structured testing approach, you can pinpoint the exact moment when viewers are most willing to pay. In this guide, we will break down the psychology behind paywall decisions, walk through proven frameworks for identifying your optimal episode, and show you how to use analytics to continuously refine your placement.",

A paywall placed after episode 3 creates a fundamentally different viewer experience than one placed after episode 6, even if both lead to the same paid content.",
