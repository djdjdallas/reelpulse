If you are posting standalone videos, either tool can give you useful data to work with.",
        "But if you are an episodic creator producing multi-episode series, vertical dramas, or serialized storytelling content, these tools have a fundamental problem: they were not designed for sequential content. Every video is treated as an independent data point, which means the most important questions for series creators go entirely unanswered.",
