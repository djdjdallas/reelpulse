The problem is that studios track fifteen metrics and optimize for none of them, because it is unclear which number should actually drive decisions. When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority.",
        "This article makes the case that revenue per episode (RPE) should be the single north star metric for short-form studios. Not because other metrics do not matter, but because RPE sits at the intersection of everything that does: content quality, audience retention, paywall effectiveness, and monetization efficiency. It is the one number that, if it improves, means almost everything else is improving too. And it is the one number that most directly answers the question every studio ultimately needs to answer: is this content worth making?",
