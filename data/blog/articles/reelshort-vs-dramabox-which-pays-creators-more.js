Both have millions of active users. Both promise creators a path to meaningful revenue from short-form content. But the details of how they pay, who watches, and what performs best differ in ways that materially affect your bottom line.",
        "This article breaks down the ReelShort versus DramaBox comparison from a purely financial and strategic perspective. We are not here to pick a winner in the abstract. The right platform depends on your genre, your production model, your audience targets, and your tolerance for different revenue structures. What we will do is give you the data and frameworks to make that decision for yourself, or to optimize if you are already publishing on both.",

Each episode typically costs between 10 and 30 coins to unlock, depending on the series tier and episode position.
