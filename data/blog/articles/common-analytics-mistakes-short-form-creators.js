But analytics only works if you are using it correctly — and most short-form series creators are making at least a few critical mistakes that undermine the entire effort.",
        "Over the past year, we have talked to hundreds of creators and studios about their analytics practices. The same mistakes come up again and again. Some are beginner errors that are easy to fix. Others are subtle traps that even experienced creators fall into. Here are the ten most common analytics mistakes we see, along with practical guidance on how to avoid each one.",
